Below I give an overview of all courses that I either ran as lecturer or where I co-ordinated or helped with conducting the exercises.  

Besides this list, 
I gave a **guest lecture** in the Space Software Course at the University of Athens in May 2023.
In June 2026, I gave an invited lecture on ["Software Development for Reuse"](https://roar-net.eu/events/training-school/software_development_for_reuse.pdf) in the 1. ROAR-NET Training School.

Furthermore, I used to teach/train _pupils_ of various ages to learn Java programming and the basic principles of software engineering.
