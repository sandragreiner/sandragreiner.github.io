## About me

In May 2024, I joined the [ACP Section](https://acp.sdu.dk/) at the University of Souther Denmark as Assistant Professor.
Between Oct 2024 and Mar 2025, I served as Interim Professor for Software Engineering at the Unviersity of Regensburg.
Before joining Fabrizio Montesi's group, I was [PostDoc](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/people/sandra/) in Timo Kehrer's [Software Engineering Group](https://seg.inf.unibe.ch/) at the University of Bern since October 2022.
I did my PhD studies and lots of teaching activities at the University of Bayreuth in the [Chair for Software Engineering](https://www.ai1.uni-bayreuth.de/de/index.html).

In 2021, I had the unique opportunity to join the [SQUARE group](https://square.itu.dk/) at the IT University of Copenhagen as guest researcher. This research visit, where I studied the synchronization of variability information, was funded by an [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/) IFI scholarship.

My research and teaching activities as well as scientific services have been recognized with various award nominations and awards.

## Research 

My research interest focuses on **software engineering**, in general, and, in particular on how to evolve complex software systems consistently.
Complex software systems encompass **highly-configurable software systems**, such as the Linux kernel or the ecosystems which allow to steer cyber-physical systems.

I strive to improve the quality and usability of software artifacts involved to steer these comples systems. Keeping information spread across heterogeneous software engineering artifacts consistent is a crucial activity to support this aim. Among others, I consider model-driven technology and software product line engineering techniques essential to solve these problems.
