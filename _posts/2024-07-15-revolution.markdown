At this year's Software Product Line Conference ([SPLC'24](https://2024.splc.net/), taking place in Luxembourg together, we will run the first [Re:Volution workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/re-volution2024/home).

The workshop joins the motivations originating from the [REVE](https://reveworkshop.github.io/2022/index.html) and [VariVolution](https://sites.google.com/view/varivolution-2023/home) workshops.
It aims to bring together active researchers who elicit software variability from (legacy) software systems and who study variability evolution from different angles.
It fosters vibrant exchange with practitioners who encounter these phenomena in real-world applications and systems. The workshop offers a platform for exchanging novel ideas, case studies, and tools and fosters future research collaborations and synergies.
